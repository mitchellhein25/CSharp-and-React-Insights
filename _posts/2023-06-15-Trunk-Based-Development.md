The article of the day for me was the following: [Why I prefer trunk-based development](https://trishagee.com/2023/05/29/why-i-prefer-trunk-based-development/?utm_source=programmingdigest&utm_medium&utm_campaign=1660). Whether you agree with the viewpoint or not, this is certainly an interesting concept to discuss.

## Definition

Trunk-Based Development (TBD) is a software development approach where all developers work on a single branch, such as 'main'. In contrast to the branching model, which promotes creating separate branches for each feature or bug fix, TBD offers several advantages that make it worth considering. Let's recap the key points from the blog post on "Why I Prefer Trunk-Based Development."

## Features/Benefits of TBD

### Speed and efficiency

By having the entire team work on a single branch, integrations are quicker and there are fewer merge conflicts. This aligns with the principles of Continuous Integration (CI), where small changes are regularly integrated into the codebase. The post emphasizes that integrating small changes frequently is usually less burdensome than dealing with a large merge after an extended period of time.

### Greater code stability

By encouraging frequent commits and pulling in other developers' changes regularly, the codebase remains stable and working. This contrasts with the branching model, where large and infrequent merges can introduce bugs that are challenging to identify and resolve due to the sheer size of the changes.

### Enhanced team collaboration

When everyone works on the same branch, there is better awareness of the changes being made, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing. In contrast, branching can create a siloed work environment, leading to knowledge gaps within the team.

### Improved Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) practices

With code committed frequently to the main branch, continuous integration becomes more straightforward. This ensures that the code is always in a deployable state, making continuous delivery more feasible. On the other hand, the branching model can introduce complexities and delays when merging and testing code from different branches, undermining the benefits of a well-established CI/CD pipeline.

### Reduce technical debt

Long-lived branches often result in challenging merges and quick fixes to resolve conflicts. By regularly merging small changes, trunk-based development enables better management and reduction of technical debt.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, trunk-based development offers clear benefits in terms of speed, code stability, team collaboration, CI/CD practices, and reduced technical debt. While it requires a mindset shift and a culture of frequent merging and small commits, the long-term benefits make it worth exploring.
