# Object Allocation in C#

This article is a recap of the concepts discussed in the informative article [Where Are Objects Allocated in C#? Understanding Heap and Stack](https://itnext.io/where-are-objects-allocated-in-c-understanding-heap-and-stack-951febcac8fe). It explores the allocation of objects in memory, focusing on the concepts of reference types, value types, stack allocation, heap allocation, and the role of the garbage collector.

## Reference Types and Heap Allocation

Reference types in C#, such as classes, interfaces, and delegates, are always allocated on the heap. When you work with reference types, you are actually working with references to the objects rather than the objects themselves. These references can be allocated on either the stack or the heap, depending on the context.

## Stack Allocation and Value Types

The stack is a memory region used for quick access, and it is limited to the method it belongs to. Value types, such as `int`, `string`, `bool`, `enum`, and `struct`, are typically allocated on the stack in certain scenarios:

- When they are declared within a method.
- When they are passed as arguments to a method.

## Heap Allocation for Value Types

Although value types are usually stack-allocated, there are cases where they can be heap-allocated. If a value type is a member of a class, it is allocated on the heap along with the containing object. This is an important distinction to be aware of when considering the lifetime and memory management of value types.

## Automatic Deallocation and the Stack

When a method returns, all the variables allocated on the stack are automatically deallocated. This means that you don't have to worry about manually freeing up memory for stack-allocated variables. The stack is designed for automatic memory management, making it convenient for managing local variables within method scopes.

## The Role of the Garbage Collector

The heap memory, where reference types and certain value types reside, is managed by the garbage collector (GC). The GC periodically checks objects on the heap to determine if they are still referenced. If an object no longer has any references, the GC deallocates the space on the heap, making it available for future allocations. Understanding the garbage collector's behavior is essential for writing memory-efficient code and avoiding memory leaks in long-running applications.

These were the main points covered in the article [Where Are Objects Allocated in C#? Understanding Heap and Stack](https://itnext.io/where-are-objects-allocated-in-c-understanding-heap-and-stack-951febcac8fe).
